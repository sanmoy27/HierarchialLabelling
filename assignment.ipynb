      "good stuff-first of all may i say it is a little expensive for an everyday soap. it makes your skin soft and very clean. the odor does not last on your body at least i can't smell it. i ran a test with my masseur. i took a shower using the cedarwood fragrance right before i had my appointment with her. i was with her less than 15 minutes after my shower. she told me there was hardly any fragrance coming off my body from the soap.i have both fragrances and have not tried the mint yet but i will run the same test on that one and let you know.\n",

      "love this!-this is an amazing products for men. it has both face and body wash. and you needn't buy different bottles for either of the areas. it works like a charm and you can you it in the shower while you're taking a shower. the texture is amazing smooth and creamy. it smells nice and the effects after washing it off leaves you fresh and charged for the rest of the day/evening. definitely recommend this to anyone who would be interested in buying a single bottle for both the face and body.\n",
