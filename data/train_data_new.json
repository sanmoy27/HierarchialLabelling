Soon after I found myself bereft of the things that smelled of home. While I don't mind diesel soot and overflowing garbage at times, I do long for those old familiar scents. I'd also began to miss the rural activities. I had no lawn to cut, no garage to tinker in, no more camouflage.\n\nFast forward a decade or two and I stumble upon this bottle of manly goodness. Upon the cracking of the ergonomically designed pop/top lid I quickly discovered that I no longer had to smell of Chad or Brock with Axe, Roy or Bill with Dial, Grayson or Skylar with Dove. No, I could now smell pleasantly obnoxious. Manly obnoxious. My glaring nostrils over-inhaled scents of 2 cycle exhaust, WD-40, and the fresh mailing of a pine through a wood chipper. When washing, I feel like angelic duct tape has wrapped my slightly major finger injury in warmth and comfort of lesser gods.\n\nAfter two weeks my chest hair has returned, I've rediscovered the Army surplus store, and currently pricing rural tracts of land contains abandoned vehicles and reeking of deer urine. My briefcase now a rucksack and my Kia has become a Ranchero. Thank Cremo, you've helped me become the man I once was. Godspeed.\n",

I thought I'd give the Method Men Body Wash a try, as it claims to not have any of the harsh chemicals as the cheaper body washes. I must say, I am completely sold on this stuff. First off, it smells amazing. A nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering like many of the other big name washes. Secondly it rinses cleanly and doesn't dry my skin out to the point of needing to slather my body in lotion after a shower. The price difference is well worth it.\n\n",

They both loved the scent, how much it foamed, and the ease of using it. My son took it with him for showers at the gym, and said that's the best way to use it. He doesn't have to worry about a shower poof, or sponge. Just foam up and rinse off. Super convenient for traveling or away from home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n\n\n",

This stuff is great! It goes on almost like a lotion, with a slightly thicker consistency than your more basic body wash. It rubs on easily, and seems to do well in cleaning the body. It also has a good smell that lingers on your body, and by the shower, for a long time. This is a really solid body wash, with the added benefit of the moisturizing lotion effect.

I refrained from the AXE line at first because of the youthful advertising but, out of curiosity, I tried the Charcoal & Mint body wash. WOW! It may startle you at first when it comes out of the tube because it's black (some say it looks dark green?). You also might think it's going to be one of those soaps with the gritty beads in it...or maybe chunks of coal? NOPE! It lathers especially well and therefore lasts a long time. The best part is the scent. It reminds me of old leather bound books with a hint of mint. That may not sound appealing (leather bound books?) but it's the first thing that came to mind when I first lathered up. And the scent lasts...I can even smell it at times the next day! Two things I would request from AXE: 1) the tube gets difficult to squeeze out the product sometimes, especially if you suffer from arthritis - a pump would be better. and 2) how about this scent as a body spray?",

Also like a shaving cream, it is thick and creamy but doesn't lather enough for my taste! I'd use a couple of handfuls to cover all my body (I'm not a big guy). It does feel refreshing and moisturizing and rinses off nicely without leaving my skin dry and/or flaky, and no soap residue either. It's a very decent product but I don't think I'll make it my choice of shampoo, body wash, shower soap\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\n",

The scent is great and it doesn't overpower or fight with anything I've put on after. I like this wash a lot, and I'm sad it's disappearing from store shelves and getting harder to find online.\n\n",

At first, I was thrown off by the scent of flowers in the body wash and after the shower was thinking, \"Why do I smell like flowers??\" If you wanted it to be more manly, make it smell like 2-stroke or Diesel. At then end of the day all the other stuff like, how it feels like you're in a rain forest with the scent.. gives you a great, in-shower experience to take you away for the 10-15 minutes you're in there. (Don't judge my long showers, I'm tall.) I just don't want to come out smelling like a Magnolia when I'm done. Other than that I would think this body wash was one of the best as far as the feel after your shower, too. .But I am more inclined to look at price on the shelf and just get a generic soap. But I was clean, refreshed, but not 'Ashy', because of all the things with soap, you don't want to be Ashy Larry when you come out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n\n",

I think the calming effect of being clean and smelling like lavender should be mandated all across the world. Have I said I love this stuff? I will now be gifting it to all my friends. I wish they would make a body spray to accompany this gel.\n",

A little goes a long way and a bottle lasts me for well over a month, (I shower at least once a day, sometimes twice, I promise!).

Plus this stuff's really been jacked up in price since it came out like ten years ago. But it works fine and does moisturize - - I don't itch or break out due to dry skin. Just please - fix the packaging - I complained about this many years ago.\n",

This was the winner and the name and bottle definitely helped sell it. But the reality is folks it has ZERO stick to it at all. I literally got out of the shower having JUST washed, normally the bathroom would smell like body wash and if you smelled your body it would definitely smell like body wash. Not this FIJI though. I smelled clean, but there was ZERO fragrance. Any old body wash can get you \"clean\" this was not what it was cracked up to be nor what the reviews make it out to be. It doesn't matter how good it smells in the store if the smells leaves 2 minutes after you exit the shower.\n",

Definitely a manly product, has that sort of aftershave scent.

Out of my usual rotation, Axe, and this specific scent, are among my favorites.\n\nThe scent of this body wash isn't in your face but it's got a bit of staying power. It's masculine with a little bit of muskiness mixed it.\n\nIn terms of lather, the equivalent of two quarters worth of wash will wash your entire body.\n\nThis is a gentle body wash. I have sensitive skin and I've never experienced any irritation.\n\nOverall, this is a great budget wash that's also fairly high in quality. Recommended. 4 stars\n\nCheers!\n",

It's not very strong on him and it leaves a good smell in the bathroom after his shower. His hair is always super smooth and soft afterwards. I ran out of shampoo one day and tried it for myself.

I have been a user of the Old Spice Swagger gel for a long time and love the scent but I wasn't sure about a foam body wash--it seemed odd. And would it smell the same? I am proud to report that it still has that same great Swagger smell and it is very easy to use with less waste (in my opinion) than the gel. With the gel, some always falls to the shower floor and goes down the drain before it ever gets applied to my body. The foam doesn't run or drip--it's a dense foam--so none gets wasted and I use less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n\n\n",

Some reviewers say it doesnt lather well, this is FAR from the truth. It lathers VERY well especially when using a loofah. The scent fills the shower and is very pleasant, my girlfriend loves the smell it leaves in the bath. The scent does linger but does not interfere or clash with any cologne. The body wash is about $1-2 more expensive than Old Spice / Axe / Dove / garden variety body wash but it is definitely worth the purchase. Cant speak to the other scents but I will be picking up the Fig again for sure. Anyone looking to try a new body wash should give it a try. Finally, unlike most of the reviews for Harry's body wash that were left by those who received free samples I paid $7 for my bottle and came to leave a review to let others know that it just really is THAT good\n\n",

That being said, GO GET THIS BODY WASH! I've used a lot of body washes- body washes for men, unisex body washes, boutique body washes - and none of them compare to this. I usually run into the same problems like generic scent, too watery, not foaming but not here. This body wash is thick and foams A LOT but doesn't feel like you have to scrub for eternity to get it off. I hate feeling like I have to use half the bottle to get myself clean (especially getting deodorant off). It also doesn't dry out my skin which is definitely a huge plus. Now for the smell... how does one express that this is the BEST smelling body wash I've ever smelled? If you're looking for a light fragrance, this ain't it, chief, but if you want something that smells amazing and lingers on your skin, this is body wash you're looking for. I will definitely recommend this to everyone I know and now, you.\n\n",

Pros can get almost anywhere, smells great, attractive packaging, moisturizing, made in the USA. Cons price and ingredients. I wish this had more natural ingredients. Alot of fragrance. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the fresh clean citrus scents. Will not purchase again though because its pricey.\n",

Normally when washing, after I rinse if I rub my hand down my stomach, it kinda catches my skin then releases then catches again etc. Its really an odd thing but it has always done it no matter what I use. Its more noticeable under your arms when it pulls your hair. When I used this for the first time, tada it didnt happen. I still felt clean, it didnt feel like I had any soap left over. It was just clean and smooth \"Hydrated\". Good buy.\n\n",

Now, I personally prefer the fig fragrance but I bought this one because I frequently get tired of using the same fragrance every day. However, this scent is still super great and it has staying power. My skin smells good for several hours after I shower. Do yourself a favor, ditch the other brands and buy this!\n",

The ease of use is where this product shines. The foam is easy to manipulate and does not lead to soap scum building up in the shower in case you drop some.

    "review": "Imposter? No cedarwood scent!-UPDATE 2: Another Cedarwood Body Wash came from Amazon today (forgot to delete from my subscription). This time it DOES smell exactly as it should. Bottom line: it's hit or miss whether your bottle of Ever Man Jack Cedarwood Body Wash will have a scent or not. I would guess this can happen with the All Over Wash, too. It may be best to buy these in a store where you can do a smell test before you buy!\n\nUPDATE 1: I found both the \"All Over Wash\" and the \"Body Wash\" in Target, and can confirm that the Body Wash simply has no scent (regardless of the CEDARWOOD printed on the bottle). The Body Wash works great for what is is... but if you're looking for that nice scent, stick with the All Over Wash!\n\nORIGINAL POST: Let me start by saying I normally love this product, and would give it a 5-star rating as it came from Target. When my Target-purchased supply ran out, I thought I'd subscribe here on Amazon and save a little money. Here's what I found (which appears to be a huge issue, judging by the other comments I've now read):\n\n1) This product from Amazon has virtually no scent, certainly not the fantastic cedarwood that I grew accustomed to from my old bottle. There is a barely perceptable, generic \"soap\" smell that is not particularly pleasant.\n\n2) The product has a different color & consistency than my old bottle. It's completely clear (vs white) and literally has about 2x the lather. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but taken together with the lack of scent, I'm guessing this could be a knock-off product.\n\nAs you can see from the photo, there is a difference in name (the new bottle from Amazon is the \"body wash\" on the right). I didn't notice that discrepancy when I purchased this from Amazon, rather assuming I found a 1:1 replacement, just in a slightly smaller container. The information on the back of both bottles is pretty similar, and appears to have all the correct company information.\n\nIncidentally, I also have the matching cedarwood deodorant, first purchased from Target, and then I bought more here on Amazon. The Amazon-purchased deodorant smells just like what I bought at Target - no issues.\n\nBottom line: if you've been using this body wash / all over wash because you love the cedarwood scent, you may be sorely disappointed purchasing it here. I know my next purchase of this stuff will be in a local store once again.\n",

The stone scent has been my favorite, it reminds me of orange zest but not as strong or overwhelming. The fact that the body wash is colorless does a lot for me too. Sometimes you can get too many different colors that are hard to clean up after, but this body wash is the real deal!\n",

    "review": "Love the smell - very little needed - skin feels amazing - fantastic value. - I haven't used Dove body wash products before but I am an instant fan\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I don't remember the name of the last body wash I got because it just ran out right before the Dove products arrived, but I do remember getting it at the store. I went down the aisle, found one in the price range I was comfortable with and that smelled fine, and I took it home. IT worked ok, but compared to this Dove product it was a quite watery, and it didn't smell anywhere as nice, nor did the smell last long.\n\nPROS:\nFragrance - I don't know what fragrance to refer to this by but I really like the smell. The name on the green label is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Extra Fresh\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and maybe that is its name - if so it is named appropriately. I won't bother trying to describe it because I'll mess that up - suffice to say it smells fantastic\n\nLong Lasting smell - I showered at around 4 and it is midnight as I'm writing this and I can still smell the body wash on my skin :)\n\nConsistency - The body wash is really thick and I love how slow moving it is when you squeeze the bottle. Unlike other products that are thinner, you won't get more than you want to use each time you need it - and that saves me money, and saving money makes me smile.\n\nQuantity needed - You really don't need a lot to get a good lather up and have a great wash. A bit around the size of a quarter was enough for my torso front and back = more saving money & more smiles :)\n\nFeeling - I not one for sitting about seeing how my skin feels, but I can definitely say that the skin on my arms feels absolutely wonderful from whatever ingredients are in this, which is probably why it is #1 rated with dermatologists.\n\nValue - It's hard to tell, but my best estimate for how long one bottle will last is 50-60 washes, and that reflects tremendous value at this price.\n\nCONS - None at all - I just hope they still make the product by the time I get to the end of the 4th bottle ;)\n\nSUMMARY - If you are reading this either you don't know Dove, or you do but you are not sure if you will like this product. Hopefully my assessment will help you determine if this is right for you. I'm quite picky when it comes to value for money and how body wash smells, and for me I definitely feel like selecting this product was a nice win for me, and when the 4th bottle is gone, I know what Ill be shopping for next\n\n",

It's a very nice manly smell, like a nice men's cologne, but it lingered for a LONG time! Our entire up stairs smelled for about 30 min of Sea + Surf after he took a shower, and our car smelled like it the entire way to our destination (about another 20 min). He smelled very nice after it wore off a bit, but at first it was pretty strong. BUT I'd take this smell over his foot stink ANY day!!! He said it was a bit too strong for his liking, so we'll see if he ends up using it...\n\n",

I've been looking to up my body/hair game a bit more since I just go with standard stuff. This seemed promising and I liked the reviews.\n\nThe scent upon opening the lid and smelling was awesome. Nice, strong scent of citrus. I've smelled a few other citrus scented stuff and this one was definitely top notch in that department.\n\nDuring the wash, the smell lingered and made a good experience in that regard. However, the lather was subpar. The beads were an interesting touch and it helped get me clean, but after a good glob on my hand, I was barely able to get a decent lather on half my body before reaching for more. Half of that with my standard wash (gel without the beads) would have done the job.\n\nAfter the shower, the scent didn't linger at all. I've only had a real noticeable lasting scent with an Old Spice body wash, so that wasn't too surprising. But still a bit disappointing since the scent was so strong during the wash. Also felt a bit more itchy and dry after this wash.\n\nI'll keep this around if I really need a good scrub down after some running or work outside (and some moisturizer handy for the dryness), but other than that, I won't be purchasing this again. I'm glad I gave it a shot though.\n",

However the packaging of the product is 30 years behind the times. You cannot put this bottle on the shelf upside-down so that product is always ready for use and so that it's easy to use 100% of what's in the bottle. What's especially annoying is that by not allowing it to be stored upside down, there is always some product left when you throw it away, and my guess is that this is intentional so that AXE can sell just a few percent more product. Hey Axe, get into the 21st century with your packaging.\n",

The smell of Bearglove deodorant is so sharp and overpowering that it made me nauseous and gave me a stabbing headache. Needless to say my husband ended up washing it off and threw it away. To be fair, I am not a fan of most masculine scented items. Chances are good that I will not like anything that says clean, water, crisp, outdoor, fresh or night. Nevertheless, it was still way too strong. The next day I purchased the Amber scent. It is not as sharp or obnoxious.\n\n",

Only problem and most important to me is the smell. Not only smells different but also lasts much less.\nFrom Rite Aid smell is crisp, lovely and last long time. First though maybe is old and affecting the smell, but then compared 2 bottles together and find difference in labels and ink coloring. Something not right see pictures.\n",

I found this product and was intrigued so figured i'd give it a try. The thing I noticed most was how \"Thick\" the product is. A lot of body wash is very watery, this product really seems to have a lot to it. With that more concentrated product, comes a really nice cedar/cypress scent and a sense that the product is really coating/cleaning wherever applied. Highly recommend giving it a try, it's definitely a different experience than a typical body wash.\n\n",

I tried Bay Rum, Tobacco and Woodsy scents and out of the six different ones I tried this most closely matches the scent I was going for. The body wash lathers well and the scent is strong without being overpowering, mellowing over time to be a nice undertone all day long. Was very pleased by the price/quantity as this was towards the lower end of price compared to other body washes and soaps and was my favorite out of the bunch. Tempted to order a backup stock in case they ever stop selling the scent. For now have this on my subscribe and save so that I can get a monthly replenishment.\n\n",

This is the only body wash my husband will use, and he will always alert me that he needs more of his \"Method man\" so that he doesn't run out. He used to have issues with body wash breaking him out on his chest and back & he had to be very particular about what kind he used. Method Men does not break him out or dry out his skin whatsoever. He is an Engineer at a car plant and comes home extra stinky, sweaty, and covered in oil at the end of the day. Method Men gets all the grease and exhaust smells off of him and leaves his skin extra fresh. He likes the Sea + surf scent the best and prefers to only use that one, but we have tried all 3. The Cedar + cypress smells a bit more \"mature\" for sure. I definitely recommend this body wash.\n\n",

I like how it stays on my bath puff instead of running through and losing half my product down the drain. It is very moisturizing and rinses off nice and clean without a stick residue left behind. I like that I got two options, 1 being a milder smell and the other a stronger and longer lasting scent with the Deep Clean scent. It is great to keep smelling fresh through a long and hot work day. I like the milder scent for before bed or when I'm having a more relaxed day. Dove never disappoints in my opinion.\n",

This scent was at one time described by the manufacturer as \"chocolate\", which I can barely imagine. I get more of a cedar scent (think faint cedar chest), along with other male-oriented fragrances. It is not \"just another scent\" which currently all seem to blend together - and as a result are unremarkable. This is unique and masculine, and I have yet to find a lady who does not like it or finds it offensive or monotonous. Hope they keep making it forever...\n\n",

    "review": "Very Powerful Smell-So let me start with this: this product smells amazing and will keep you smelling fresh all day. However, it isn't subtle in the slightest (and will burn a bit if you get it on your eyelids or other sensitive areas). People will actively be able to smell you from feet away. The smell won't come out of your washcloth even after going through the wash. It's pretty extreme.\nI rated three stars because of how strong it is, so I wouldn't recommend it for daily use. I will however continue to purchase it and use it for occasions where smelling like body wash all day is appropriate, such as on long hikes or runs.",

If it weren't for the labeling, I couldn't have told what the scent was. I had my wife give it the sniff test just in case my sniffer was off that day; she confirmed there was little smell.\n\nI hoped it would be different once I lathered it on in the shower, but no improvement. Not much scent, and it goes without saying it's not long-lasting when there's none there to start with.\n\nOn the positive side, I love that the bottle is shaped like a flaskway cool. And I think it does an adequate job of cleaning and it doesn't dry out my skin. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I guess the search continues.\n",

It does a good job on my hair and does not leave it feeling all dried out and in need of conditioner, as a body wash it works great with a good lather, nice clean feeling after and a pleasant smell that does stay with you awhile after your out. It washes off clean with no residue ad the bottle came with a pump top which makes it much more user friendly.\n",

The main ingredient in this Dove Men+Care (after water) is what you find in many soaps: sodium laureth sulfate.\n\nThis Dove Men+Care is a good soap. It gets me clean. It's not much better or worse then most other soaps.\n\nIt does contain fragrance and coloring (Blue 1, Red 33, Yellow 5), which I find unnecessary. I prefer clear soaps and detergents. The fragrance is faint and pleasant. It lingers on my skin. This body wash's color is green (see my photo), the result of combining all those Blue and Red and Yellow coloring agents.\n\nThis body wash claims to contain \"micromoisture,\" a \"patent filed technology\" that's \"clinically proven to fight skin dryness better than any regular men's body wash.\"\n\nI didn't notice any increase in my skin's moisture. But like I said, it's a good liquid soap. Comes in a very big 18 oz bottle, that will last a long time.\n\n",
