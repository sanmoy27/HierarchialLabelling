It smells good and my wife often comments how much she likes it.\n\nI would have given it five stars, but it really rankles me that the manufacturer is trying to pass this product off as \"naturally derived.\" The number two ingredient after water is sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant and foaming agent that gives you that nice lathery feeling that tells you you're getting clean. Yes, it can be derived from coconut or palm oil rather than from petroleum, and I guess that's what the manufacturer means.\n\nBut it's still sodium lauryl sulfate, for Pete's sake. I'm no rampant environmentalist that is going to tell you SLS will give you cancer. The FDA has tested and approved it. But when folks look for natural ingredients, it's not usually SLS they are seeking. There are plenty of people who will tell SLS is very dangerous. Even mainstream folks recognize it can irritate sensitive skin.\n\nNice body wash. But don't tell me your SLS product is natural. Please. This is just betting on consumer ignorance.\n",

TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT EVER TRIED THIS PRODUCT (WHICH I DISCOVERED ABOUT 7 YEARS AGO) LET ME TELL YOU HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO BE READING THIS REVIEW AND THAT AMAZON STOCKS/SELLS THIS PRODUCT THAT USED TO BE CALLED\"RATTLESNAKE PEEL\". I CAN'T EXPRESS TO ANYONE HOW BUMMED OUT I WAS WHEN I COULDN'T FIND ANYWHERE TO PURCHASE THIS FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS. FOR SOME REASON I NEVER THOUGHT OF CHECKING ON AMAZON FOR AXE PRODUCTS. I LEAVE THIS REVIEW WITH INCREDIBLE HAPPINESS AND PLEASURE......THIS IS SOOOOOOO EFFECTIVE FOR DEEP CLEANSING OF YOUR FACE AND BODY. IT HAS AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO SUCK UP ANY EXCESSIVE OIL THAT CAUSES ACNE TO FORM IN THE AREA. BUT AMAZINGLY AFTER RINSING OFF THE SNAKE PEEL YOUR FACIAL SKIN AND BODY HAVE THE SOFTNESS OF A BABY'S BOTTOM. I DID A DOUBLE TAKE WHEN I SAW THAT AMAZON STOCKS/SELLS THIS AND HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS THE SAME THING THAT I HAD USED YEAR'S AGO. BUYING THE THREE PACK OR MORE IS YOUR BEST BET..... BELIEVE ME YOU'LL USE IT OR GIVE ONE TO A GOOD FRIEND TO TRY. EXPECT TO PAY JUST A LITTLE OVER FIVE DOLLARS PER BOTTLE FOR A FAIR PRICE. TY.... MICHAEL",
